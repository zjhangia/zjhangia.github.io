        <h1>36.Belling The Cat<i><small><h4>By Rob John</h4></small></i></h1>
        <p>The mice who lived on a farm were very happy because the farmer’s cat which was supposed to hunt and kill mice was old and lazy and spent most of his time sleeping in the sunshine.</p>
        <p>‘Can’t be bothered with catching mice any more,’ said the old cat. ‘All that lurking about and pouncing. Got better things to do...like sleeping.’
        </p>
        <p>So the mice ran about safely all over the farm and had plenty to eat...until one day an awful thing happened.
        </p>
        <p>The farmer came into the farmyard carrying a wooden box. He put it on the floor and...out of the box walked a cat; a new young cat with black sleek fur and long sharp claws. The cat looked around the farmyard and she sniffed the air.</p>
        <p>‘Huh, she’s nothing to be scared of,’ said a young mouse. ‘She’s only a cat. Only a lazy old cat.’</p>
        <p>But an old mouse wasn’t so sure. The new cat didn’t look old...or lazy. This cat looked young and keen and...hungry.</p>
        <p>‘Just be careful,’ said the old mouse. ‘Just keep your eyes open and be very careful.’</p>
        <p>That night the new cat prowled the farmyard. She walked silently in the darkness; invisible in her black coat. She watched and she waited; listening for the tiniest sound.</p>
        <p>In the morning when the mice met for breakfast in the barn there didn’t seem to be quite so many of them.
        </p>
        <p>‘Where is everyone this morning?’ said the young mouse.</p>
        <p>‘I wonder,’ said the old mouse looking at the new cat who was sitting outside the farmhouse with a big smile on her face.</p>
        <p>Each night more mice disappeared… and the new cat seemed to be getting fatter.</p>
        <p>Soon the mice were really scared.</p>
        <p>Finally the old mouse called a meeting.</p>
        <p>‘We have to do something,’ he said. ‘If we can’t get rid of this cat she’ll end up eating us all. We need a plan.’
        </p>
        <p>‘The problem,’ said the old mouse, ‘is that you can’t hear the cat coming. She moves silently in the darkness. You don’t know she’s there...until it’s too late.’</p>
        <p>‘That’s it!’ said the young mouse. ‘We get a bell and tie it round the cat’s neck. The bell will ring every time the cat moves and we’ll know where she is so she’ll never catch us.’
        </p>
        <p>The mice all looked at each other. ‘Not bad,’ said someone.</p>
        <p>‘Actually, that’s brilliant!’ said someone else.</p>
        <p>The mice leapt into action. One group found a little bell that had fallen off the back of the farmhouse door and another found some string which had been holding up a scarecrow’s trousers.</p>
        <p>‘See,’ said the young mouse. ‘We have everything we need for my brilliant plan. That cat has eaten her last mouse. All our troubles are over.’
        </p>
        <p>The mice all cheered and patted the young mice on the back. The young mouse had saved everyone from being eaten and suddenly he was a hero...for about ten seconds.</p>
        <p>‘Just one question,’ said the old mouse. ‘Who’s going to tie the bell on the cat?’</p>
        <p>The mice all went silent then looked at the young mouse. The young mouse looked at the floor.</p>
        <p>He didn’t want that job. Nobody wanted that job.</p>
        <p>‘Oh dear,’ said the old mouse. ‘It’s easy to say something but often harder to actually do it.’</p>
