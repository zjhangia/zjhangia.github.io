        <h1>34.The Eagle And The Tortoise<i><small><h4>By Kate Stonham</h4></small></i></h1>
        <p>In a tumbledown cottage deep in the countryside lived Old Mrs Mumbles. Every morning, she opened the kitchen door…and threw the remains of last night’s dinner onto the grass.</p>
        <p>‘Three, two, one…bet I get there first!’ cried Racy Rabbit.</p>
        <p>All the animals that lived in the garden charged towards the food – all except Tod the very slow tortoise.</p>
        <p>‘Wait for me…!’ he croaked. But it was no good – Racy Rabbit, Fox and the birds were greedily tucking into vegetable peelings and left over stew…and by the time Tod arrived, there was nothing left.</p>
        <p>‘It’s not faaaaaair, he moaned. ‘I’ve only got short little legs and my shell is really heavy. I’m so slow I always get there last.’</p>
        <p>‘Never mind, Tod,’ squeaked his friend, Milly Mouse. ‘Look, I’ve saved you a nice piece of lettuce.’</p>
        <p>As Tod chomped away, he spotted a great Eagle soaring on the light breeze way up high.</p>
        <p>‘I wish I could fly like that eagle,’ he sighed. ‘Just imagine how fast and free I would be!’</p>
        <p>The next day, Tod poked his head from his shell – and nearly jumped out of it in surprise. For the eagle was standing on the grass, looking right at him.</p>
        <p>‘Us eagles have very good eyesight you know’, she said in a rather raspy voice. ‘I read your lips yes- terday. And I have come to grant you your wish. I shall teach you to fly in the sky.’</p>
        <p>‘Ohhh! Thank you, Eagle!’ cried Tod. ‘I’ll give you anything you want in return.’</p>
        <p>‘Anything?’ asked the Eagle with a glint in her eye.</p>
        <p>‘Yes, anything,’ replied Tod.</p>
        <p>Tod gasped with excitement as the Eagle carried him high into the sky. Mountains and oceans and forests and castles were spread out below as far as he could see.</p>
        <p>‘I can fly!’ cried Tod with delight.</p>
        <p>‘Now, there’s just the small mat- ter of my payment,’ said the Eagle. ‘I’m rather partial to small, cud- dly creatures for my tea, so I’d like that little mouse you were talking too.’
        </p>
        <p>‘What?! But you can’t eat Milly – she’s my best friend,’ protested Tod. ‘But you promised to give me whatever I wanted,’ said the Eagle. ‘Er, yes I know - but not Milly, pleeeease…’ pleaded Tod.</p>
        <p>There was a horrible silence. Todd shivered in the cold wind and looked down. It was an awfully long way to the ground…</p>
        <p>‘Very well then,’ said the Eagle.</p>
        <p>‘You wanted to fly – so let’s see how you manage by yourself.’ And with that, she shook Tod off her back.
        </p>
        <p>‘Heeeeeeelp!’ cried Tod as he fell through the air. ‘You forgot to tell me how to do it!!!’</p>
        <p>‘It’s easy, just flap!’ cried the now distant Eagle.</p>
        <p>Tod flapped and flapped his little legs, but it was no use. Down he dropped like a very heavy stone.</p>
        <p>‘I don’t think I like flying after all…’ he gasped. ‘I’d much rather be back on the ground. The prob- lem is, the ground’s getting very close…very fast…!’</p>
        <p>As the garden rushed up to meet him, Tod shut his eyes…then ever so slowly…opened them again…
        </p>
        <p>He had landed in a giant pile of let- tuce leaves. ‘We thought we’d give you a soft landing just in case your flying lesson went horribly wrong,’ giggled Racy Rabbit.</p>
        <p>‘Lucky for you, Old Mrs Mumbles had a big party last night, and threw out loads of left overs!’ added Milly.</p>
        <p>That night, the animals celebrated with a feast. ‘Thanks for saving my life, guys,’ said Tod as he chomped on lettuce. ‘You know, I much prefer being slow and steady to flying all fast and whizzy. I even like my shell a bit more.’</p>
        <p>He pulled his little friend under his shell, and they munched to their hearts’ content till the sun came out again.</p>
