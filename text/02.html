        <p>'Mum! Mum! Come quickly!' called the little frog, hopping and skipping with excitement...</p>
        <p>'Come and see the monster!' He called.</p>
        <p>'It’s got two big spikes sticking out of its head and a funny brush thing at the other end and it goes "OAR- RR AGH!" And it kicks frogs.'</p>
        <p>'Not now dear,' said the little frog's mother.</p>
        <p>'Come on mum! Please!'</p>
        <p>Mother frog looked more closely at the little one.</p>
        <p>'You're Stanley, aren't you?' 'No mum, I'm Zebadee.' 'Are you really? You all look so alike.'</p>
        <p>She had 247 children, and it is hard to remember that many names, so she called everyone Stanley to give her memory a rest.</p>
        <p>'Mu-ummm…' cried Zebedee, 'I haven’t finished breakfast, dear.'</p>
        <p>The little frog hesitated. 'Can I have some then?'</p>
        <p>'No, Stanley,' she said. 'You’re not a tadpole any more. Go and find your own slugs - and stop jiggling about, you're giving me a head- ache.'</p>
        <p>'I'm not jiggling about, I'm hopping about.'</p>
        <p>'Well stop it. It looks like exercise, and I can’t be having with that sort of thing. How would it be if I were to flip and flop about like you, doing exercise?'</p>
        <p>The little frog thought about it.</p>
        <p>'You wouldn't be so podgy,' he said.</p>
        <p>'Exactly!' said his mother. 'You don’t get a jelly-belly like mine by exercising. I get all the exercise I need chewing. Now, what's all the fuss about?'</p>
        <p>'It's an Ox! And it's really gross and his shoes have split down the middle.'</p>
        <p>'There are no such things as mon- sters, Stanley, and no creature in the pond is bigger than me.'</p>
        <p>'But it is bigger than you, mum. Lot's bigger. I promise.'</p>
        <p>'Right!' said his mum. 'We'll see about that! I'll go with you, and if you are telling fibs you'll have no worms for a week.'</p>
        <p>The damp hollow she sat in was home to a good assortment of slugs.
        </p>
        <p>But she had eaten too many of them. The big jelly-belly she was so proud of made it difficult to get about. Now she could only half- hop, and flop, and then stop. Hop, flop and stop, until she was all tired out and could go no further.</p>
        <p>'Stop, Stanley!'</p>
        <p>'You’ve only moved half a metre, mum.'</p>
        <p>'Far enough,' she wheezed. She took a deep breath – and then she took a deep breath – and then she took a deep breath.</p>
        <p>'Is the ox as big as this?' she asked.</p>
        <p>She sounded odd, because it's hard to speak, blown up like a beach ball.</p>
        <p>'Much bigger than that,' said the little frog.</p>
        <p>So she sucked in more air, and sucked in more air, and sucked in more air.</p>
        <p>'No, mum – it's still bigger…'</p>
        <p>So she took in another breath, and …and…she shot into the air like an escaped balloon that zips around the room making rude noises because you let go of the end.</p>
        <p>'YAAAAAH!' she yelled, looping-the- loop and fizzing off in all directions before crashing - with a spectacular splash - right in front of the ox! The ox looked bored with the whole thing. Water dribbled from his mouth.</p>
        <p>'Stanley!' she called back to the little frog a field and a half away. 'Let that be a lesson to you!'</p>
        <p>But the lesson was hers really.</p>
