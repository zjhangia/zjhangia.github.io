        <h1>39.The Ant And The Dove<i><small><h4>By Kate Stonham</h4></small></i></h1>
        <p>It was another hot, dry day in the forest…</p>
        <p>Ant had been wandering over crinkly, dry leaves for days in search of a nice, cool drink…</p>
        <p>‘All I need is a drop of rain falling from a leaf – or a tiny pool of dew on a flower petal – or even a muddy puddle…’ he thought. But it was so hot all the dew and puddles in the forest had dried up.</p>
        <p>‘I’m so thirsty, that I have no choice,’ Ant sighed at last. ‘I shall have to go in search of the Roaring River.’
        </p>
        <p>Ant had been warned about the Roaring River. ‘It roars and it swirls and if you go too close, it will sweep you away,’ a wise owl had told him.</p>
        <p>But Ant was desperate. ‘The river has more drops of water than all the rain clouds in the world,’ he thought. ‘It’s my only hope of staying alive.’</p>
        <p>So Ant headed off. He plodded on and on through the trees, until finally, he heard rushing water ahead…
        </p>
        <p>Before him lay the Roaring River – as vast as a sea, or so it seemed to tiny Ant. The fast flowing waters looked frightening – but Ant was too thirsty to feel fear…</p>
        <p>He clambered down the river bank and bent his weary head into the water to drink it up.</p>
        <p>The cool, sparkling water was so refreshing that Ant didn’t hear a roaring wave coming towards him…
        </p>
        <p>Suddenly, he was flat on his back - his little legs in the air, being swept away by the water! ‘Help!’ he cried. ‘Someone save me, please!’</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, a green leaf dropped onto the water by his side with a plop. ‘Quick, climb on!’ cried a gentle cooing voice.</p>
        <p>Ant didn’t have time to see who the voice belonged to. He just did what it told him…then he opened his eyes and looked up.</p>
        <p>Perching on the branch of a tree above was a pure white Dove.</p>
        <p>‘Stay calm, little Ant - and wait for the gentle breeze to blow the leaf to the river bank,’ she cooed.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, the leaf carried Ant to safety. He looked up – but the Dove had disappeared. ‘I can’t leave without thanking her,’ he thought. ‘So I shall wait until she returns.’
        </p>
        <p>Ant waited and waited. Then, just as he was about to fall asleep, he heard strange noises. They were coming closer and closer…</p>
        <p>Two men emerged from the forest and stopped under the Dove’s tree.</p>
        <p>One was carrying a bucket – the other a large, golden cage. ‘This is the tree – the home of the most beautiful dove in the land,’ said the man with the cage. ‘I hope that glue in your bucket is sticky enough…’
        </p>
        <p>‘Indeed it is,’ said the second as he covered the branch with a thick, green paste. ‘When the Dove lands, its feet will stick to the branch – then we can put it in the cage and take it to the King. All we have to do is hide and wait…’</p>
        <p>Ant was horrified. ‘I can’t let this happen!’ he thought. ‘But what can a tiny creature like me do against two such giants of men?’</p>
        <p>Ant looked up as he heard the flapping of wings. The Dove had returned and was about to land on the sticky branch…! ‘If I’m going to act, I must use the only weapon I have…’ thought Ant. ‘And I must do it RIGHT NOW!’</p>
        <p>So he jumped onto the men’s feet – and bit as hard as he could…time and time again…</p>
        <p>‘Yow!!!’ they cried out in pain and took to their heels through the forest.</p>
        <p>‘Thank you for saving me from a life in a cage,’ cooed the Dove to Ant.
        </p>
        <p>‘And thank you for saving me from the giant wave,’ replied Ant.</p>
