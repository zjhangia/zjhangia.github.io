        <h1>20.The Lion And The Elephant<i><small><h4>By Jan Payne</h4></small></i></h1>
        <p>It was nearly morning and the Lion had just gone to bed.</p>
        <p>He pulled the grass duvet over his head and closed his eyes.</p>
        <p>He was just about to fall asleep when a noise sounded across the plain.</p>
        <p>‘COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!’ It was the Cockerel crowing. ‘COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!’
        </p>
        <p>The Lion put his paws over his ears.
        </p>
        <p>‘Go away,’ he cried, ‘go away!’</p>
        <p>But the Cockerel didn’t want to go away. He wanted to tell the world what a beautiful morning it was.</p>
        <p>The Lion kept his head under the duvet.
        </p>
        <p>‘That noise is driving me mad,’ he said. It was the same every morn- ing. The sun came up and the Cockerel crowed. And each time he heard it the Lion hated it more. It made him feel afraid.</p>
        <p>‘Why is it,’ he asked himself, ‘that someone like me, who is brave and strong and fearless should be afraid of the sound of a harmless cockerel?’</p>
        <p>He decided to talk to the other animals.
        </p>
        <p>‘Monkeys,’ he asked, ‘does the sound of the Cockerel make you feel afraid?’</p>
        <p>‘No,’ said the monkeys together. ‘We’re not afraid of anything.’</p>
        <p>‘Hippopotamus,’ asked the Lion, ‘you are big and strong like me. Is there anything that frightens you?’</p>
        <p>The hippopotamus was bathing in the river. He blew a stream of bubbles out of his nose.</p>
        <p>‘Nothing frightens me,’ he said.</p>
        <p>‘Not even the sound of a cockerel crowing.’</p>
        <p>‘Especially not the sound of a cockerel crowing.’</p>
        <p>Ashamed of his weakness the Lion turned away. A crocodile was sunbathing near by.</p>
        <p>‘Are you afraid of anything, Croco- dile?’ the Lion asked.</p>
        <p>The crocodile thought for a moment. </p>
        <p>‘Jam sandwiches!’ he answered.</p>
        <p>The Lion thought this was a strange thing for the crocodile to be afraid about, but he didn’t argue.</p>
        <p>Just then an elephant lumbered out of the forest.</p>
        <p>‘If anyone can answer my question, he can,’ thought the Lion.</p>
        <p>‘Elephant, can I speak to you?’ he asked.</p>
        <p>‘Not today, Lion,’ said the Elephant, shaking his head. ‘I have a problem.’</p>
        <p>‘Is it a serious problem?’ asked the Lion.</p>
        <p>‘It is to me,’ said the Elephant. And he shook his head so hard the Lion thought the elephant’s ears would come off.</p>
        <p>‘I’ve got a serious problem too,’ said the Lion.</p>
        <p>‘Well, you tell me your serious problem and I’ll tell you mine,’ said the Elephant.</p>
        <p>So the Lion told the Elephant all about how afraid he was of the crowing of the cock.</p>
        <p>‘I sympathise with you, Lion,’ said the Elephant. And he gave his head another massive shake.</p>
        <p>‘Do you see a small insect buzzing around?’ he continued.</p>
        <p>The Lion could just make out a gnat near the Elephant’s head.</p>
        <p>‘If that insect flies inside my ears,’ continued the Elephant, ‘I am positive I am done for.’</p>
        <p>‘You mean you are afraid of a tiny gnat?’ queried the Lion.</p>
        <p>‘Yes,’ said the Elephant.</p>
        <p>The Lion thought about this for a minute. It was hard to believe that such a strong, wise and clever animal could be afraid of so small a thing.
        </p>
        <p>Now the Lion felt sorry for the Elephant.</p>
        <p>‘Your fear is worse than mine,’ he told him. ‘I am sorry now I troubled you at all.’</p>
        <p>‘I’m glad you did,’ said the Elephant.</p>
        <p>The next morning when the Cock crowed the Lion turned over in bed and went back to sleep.</p>
        <p>‘It’s just a noise,’ he told himself, ‘it can’t possibly hurt me.’</p>
        <p>And he was right.</p>
