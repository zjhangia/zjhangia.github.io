        <h1>10.The Miller, His Son And The Donkey
            <i><small><h4>By Sue Reid</h4></small></i>
        </h1>
        <p>‘Fetch our old donkey,’ the miller said to his son one day. ‘We’re taking him to market. We need money and we’ve nothing else to sell.’</p>
        <p>The son ran to the stable where the donkey was kept. He threw a halter over its neck. And the donkey wasn’t happy!!!</p>
        <p>‘Grumpy old thing!’ said the son, as he led the donkey out of the stable. ‘I’m not sorry we’re selling you!’</p>
        <p>‘I’m not sorry either,’ brayed the donkey. ‘When was the last time you gave me a carrot!’</p>
        <p>‘We won’t ride him,’ said the miller. ‘It’ll be easier to sell him if he’s not tired.’</p>
        <p>They led the donkey down the street towards the town.</p>
        <p>‘Hey, you,’ a man shouted suddenly. ‘Why don’t you ride the donkey?’</p>
        <p>‘That’s what it’s for!’ another man hollered.</p>
        <p>The crowd began to laugh.</p>
        <p>The miller hated to be laughed at. ‘Get up, son,’ he said. The son climbed up on to the donkey’s back. </p>
        <p>‘At least it’s the smaller one,’ the donkey grumbled as he felt the son’s weight on his back. ‘Some- thing to be grateful for, I suppose.’</p>
        <p>But they hadn’t travelled far before they passed three merchants, whispering and shaking their heads.</p>
        <p>‘What is the world coming to?’ the miller heard one of them say. ‘Get down, young man. Let your master ride the donkey.’</p>
        <p>The miller thought he’d better do as they said. ‘Hop down, lad, and help me up,’ he said to his son.</p>
        <p>So the son climbed down and helped his father clamber up. ‘Ee-aw!’ grumbled the donkey, as the miller landed on his back. ‘What a lump. Worse than a sack of potatoes.’</p>
        <p>His back was hard and bony. The miller wasn’t sorry when they reached the gates of the town. A group of girls were standing there, bags and baskets in their hands. The miller pulled on the donkey’s halter. ‘Whoa!’ he said. ‘Let the ladies through
            first.’
        </p>
        <p>‘Cor, look at that poor boy,’ one of the girls said, seeing the son lead the donkey, his father on top. ‘His master should let him ride too.’</p>
        <p>'Lazy thing.'</p>
        <p>The miller was a bit cross, but he liked to please. ‘Get up behind me, son,’ he said.</p>
        <p>‘What! Both of you at once!’ the donkey screeched. ‘I’m an old donkey. Ee-aw!’</p>
        <p>‘Look at that poor creature,’ a woman said as the donkey crawled slowly along the road, head droop- ing. ‘Two of them on his back.’</p>
        <p>‘And one of them so big!’ said her friend.</p>
        <p>‘They should be carrying it!’</p>
        <p>‘Yes, they are right,’ thought the miller, and climbed down. ‘Get down, son. We’ll carry him between us.’ They tied the donkey’s legs to a pole, the donkey slung between them.
        </p>
        <p>‘Now they know what it’s like to be a donkey - carrying great loads all day,’ he thought as the miller and his son stumbled down the street.</p>
        <p>The townspeople had never seen such a sight before. They ran out of their houses to watch. ‘Don’t they look silly’, they laughed.</p>
        <p>The donkey hated to be laughed at. He pushed and he pulled, trying to free himself.</p>
        <p>Slowly the ropes that bound him began to loosen. ‘One – more – heave,’ he gasped as they stumbled up to the bridge.</p>
        <p>And with a final tug and a kick he was free. Over the bridge he tum- bled. Down, down, down he fell. Splash! Into the river below. He thrashed and he brayed. But there was nothing he could do.</p>
        <p>‘Ee-aw. Ee-aw,’ he cried. Ee— aw!’
        </p>
        <p>The miller watched helplessly as his donkey was swept away.</p>
        <p>‘Silly me,’ he said as he and his son trudged homewards. ‘By trying to please everyone I have lost my donkey - and now I have nothing left to sell.’</p>
