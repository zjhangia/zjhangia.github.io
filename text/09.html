        <h1>09.The Dog,The Cockerl And The Fox<i><small><h4>By Tracey Hammett</h4></small></i></h1>
        <p>Dog lived in the farmyard and it was her job to let everyone know when someone was at the gate.</p>
        <p>And she did her job very well.</p>
        <p>Cockerel lived in the farmyard too and it was his job to wake every- one up in the morning!</p>
        <p>He was an excellent alarm clock.</p>
        <p>One day Dog said to Cockerel 'Let's go for an adventure in the big wide world.' </p>
        <p>'I'm not sure that's a good idea,' Cockerel replied, 'I've heard that there's a fox nearby whose favour- ite food is cockerel pie!'</p>
        <p>'Well if a fox tries to bake you in a pie!' said Dog, 'I'll soon sort him out…GRRRRR GRRRR!'</p>
        <p>'In that case, I'll come with you!' said Cockerel.</p>
        <p>So off they went.</p>
        <p>The big wide world was wide indeed…with sky at the top and hills underneath and a squiggly path that seemed to go on forever.</p>
        <p>The two friends journeyed along the path, then, just as the sun slipped behind the hills they came to a wood.</p>
        <p>'It'll be dark soon,' said Cockerel. 'Let's find a place to sleep.'</p>
        <p>'This tree looks perfect,' woofed Dog, 'it's big and it's hollow, so I can curl up inside and keep guard!'</p>
        <p>'And there's a wide branch where I can roost!' said Cockerel.</p>
        <p>Dog curled up in the hollow tree and Cockerel roosted on the branch.</p>
        <p>Suddenly they heard a sound.</p>
        <p>'What was that?' said Cockerel.</p>
        <p>'Just an owl,' woofed Dog.</p>
        <p>'Oh, thank goodness,' said Cockerel,'I thought it was a fox coming to gobble me up!'</p>
        <p>'Yes,' said Cockerel, 'foxes are slinky and sneaky and sly and their favourite food is cockerel pie!'</p>
        <p>'I'll protect you!' said Dog, 'A fox can't find you on that branch anyway, not unless you cock-a-doodle- doo.'
        </p>
        <p>'That's true!' said Cockerel. 'Good- night, Dog!'</p>
        <p>'Goodnight, Cockerel - and remember not to cock-a-doodle-doo in the morning, or the fox might hear you!'</p>
        <p>Cockerel slept happily after that.</p>
        <p>But in the morning when the sun came up, he thought he was still on the farm. So he let out a loud COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO. Which woke up Fox.</p>
        <p>'Ooops!' clucked Cockerel, 'Now I've gone and done it!'</p>
        <p>'Good morning, Cockerel,' growled Fox. </p>
        <p>'Good morning!' Cockerel replied nervously</p>
        <p>Fox narrowed his eyes, 'I haven't seen you in this wood before!'</p>
        <p>'I only arrived last night,' clucked Cockerel nervously.</p>
        <p>'Why don't you invite me up, it would be rude not to,' said Fox.</p>
        <p>'I haven't tidied up yet!' said Cockerel, 'Pop back later!'</p>
        <p>'I don't mind if your branch is untidy!' said Fox.</p>
        <p>Cockerel sighed, 'Come on up then,' he said slyly. 'Go round to the door at the bottom of the tree and my porter will let you in!'</p>
        <p>Fox grinned to himself a sneaky grin…a thread of drool hung from his chin. He went to the hollow in the tree…where Dog was waiting patiently.
        </p>
        <p>'Hey, Mr Fox, you wanted to trick me and gobble me up, but I tricked you instead!' clucked Cockerel.</p>
        <p>Fox ran off as fast as he could… and he's never been seen in that part of the wood again.</p>
        <p>'That was an adventure!' Dog yapped.</p>
        <p>And home they went to tell the tale of how the Fox’s plan had failed.</p>
