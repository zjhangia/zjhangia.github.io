        <h1>16.The Cat And The Mice<i><small><h4>By Sharri McGarry</h4></small></i></h1>
        <p>On the kitchen table was a smelly cheese. The smell wafted through the kitchen. The smell spiralled down the hole in the skirting board. The smell drifted into the noses of three little mice.</p>
        <p>'I love ch...ch...cheese!' whined Mini-Mouse, hungrily.</p>
        <p>'So do I!' squeaked Mildred-Mouse.</p>
        <p>Mighty-Mouse narrowed his eyes, 'Mission required to steal cheese!' he said.</p>
        <p>In the kitchen lived a cat.</p>
        <p>'I'm a Terrible-Tiger-Cat!' said the cat, prowling across the floor.</p>
        <p>And this Terrible-Tiger-Cat had the important job of guarding the cheese from pesky mice.</p>
        <p>Under the skirting boards, the smell of cheese was too much for the mice.</p>
        <p>'Right!' said Mighty-Mouse.</p>
        <p>'Right,' said Mighty-Mouse, 'Mini- Mouse you go on my right side, Mildred-Mouse goes on my left and we'll rush out, steal the cheese and get back quick. OK?'</p>
        <p>'What makes you think this plan will work?' said Mildred-Mouse.</p>
        <p>'Trust me!' said Mighty-Mouse confidently. 'We have the element of surprise! Let’s GO!'</p>
        <p>Under the kitchen table sat the Terrible-Tiger-Cat. He watched as three little mice shot out of the hole in the skirting board.</p>
        <p>'Mice? I'll catch 'em! I'll snatch 'em!'</p>
        <p>The Terrible-Tiger-Cat opened his terrible mouth and showed his terrible teeth.</p>
        <p>'Wait for me!' yelled Mighty-Mouse.</p>
        <p>In the hole under the skirting boards, three little mice panted for breath.</p>
        <p>'N...n...now what?' asked Mini- Mouse.</p>
        <p>'NOW,' said Mildred-Mouse, with grim determination. 'We forget the cheese! We don’t need it!'</p>
        <p>And she marched off, leaving Mighty-Mouse looking embar- rassed.
        </p>
        <p>In the kitchen, the Terrible-Tiger- Cat waited. There was no sign of mice. The Terrible-Tiger-Cat was bored.
        </p>
        <p>'Mice? I'll catch 'em! I'll snatch 'em!...if I can thee 'em! 'Humm… maybe if I wasn’t here, the mice would come out! Maybe, if I pretend to not be here…'</p>
        <p>Terrible-Tiger-Cat looked up at a sack that hung from the wall. The sack was grey. Terrible-Tiger-Cat looked at his fur. His fur was grey also.
        </p>
        <p>'Now,' he said thoughtfully. 'If I take this sack down from the wall… and if I climb up and hang myself there instead…I would look like a sack and not like a cat! Clever, eh?'</p>
        <p>So Terrible-Tiger-Cat hung himself from the wall and waited.</p>
        <p>Down the hole Mini-Mouse groaned.</p>
        <p>'The smell of ch...cheese is killing me! If I could have one taste…'</p>
        <p>'Get back here!' said Mildred, grabbing Mini-Mouse’s tail and pull- ing him back. 'B...b...but NO CAT!' said Mini-Mouse excitedly.</p>
        <p>'Humm,' said Mildred. 'NEVER trust a cat!'</p>
        <p>She poked her snout out cautiously. Mildred looked up at the sack hang- ing on the wall. The sack with the two bright eyes.</p>
        <p>'No cat?' Mildred smiled wryly. 'THEN WHAT’S THAT HANGING ON THE WALL?'</p>
        <p>And the Terrible-Tiger-Cat replied, 'Waaaoow! I’m only an old sack!'</p>
        <p>'C...c...cat!' stuttered Mini-Mouse.</p>
        <p>'Abandon plan!' said Mighty- Mouse.</p>
        <p>'Come on!' laughed Mildred, 'Let's get back to the mousehole.'</p>
        <p>And there was silence in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>'Ooopth!' said the Terrible-Tiger- Cat. 'I wonder what gave me away?'</p>
