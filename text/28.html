        <h1>28.The Wolf In Sheep's Clothing<i><small><h4>By Tracey Hammett</h4></small></i></h1>
        <p>Mr Wolf dreamt of eating a nice woolly sheep for his supper…but he just couldn't catch one.</p>
        <p>He spent his time spying on the sheep in Farmer Foggarty's field… and thinking of wily ways to catch them. But his wily ways never seemed to work.</p>
        <p>One time he'd waited behind a rock for hours just so he could pounce on a juicy sheep…but when he heard the sound of hooves and he leapt out of his hiding place…it was not a sheep he pounced on… …but an angry bull.</p>
        <p>It looked like Mr Wolf was never going to get a Sheepie Supper.</p>
        <p>Then one day when he was visiting his Auntie Marge, he noticed a large sheep skin rug on the floor.</p>
        <p>'Ha, he thought, I will borrow Auntie Marge's rug and disguise myself as a sheep, then I can easily get into Farmer Foggarty's Vheep pen; and once I'm in there - gnash,gnash, gobble, gobble…I will have my sheepie supper!'</p>
        <p>As soon as he arrived home with the sheepskin rug he dressed him- self up and then practised talking in Sheep language.</p>
        <p>It was tricky at first:'baaa…grrrr… baaa…grrr!' But he soon got the hang of it 'Baaa! Baaa! Baaa!'</p>
        <p>Then he set off to Farmer Foggarty's field to join the sheep. On the way he checked his reflection in the pond. 'I look cute,' he said. 'Baaaa-ootiful!'</p>
        <p>Farmer Foggarty’s sheep were grazing happily when Mr Wolf slyly slipped amongst the flock. He nibbled some grass just like they did. But it tasted yucky.</p>
        <p>So far his plan was working; the sheep didn't seem to notice him, even though he was larger than they were; they all just kept nibbling the grass.</p>
        <p>'I'll wait til sunset when the farmer puts the sheep in the pen and when I'm tucked up tight with them - gnash, gnash, gobble, gobble, I'll have a delicious sheepie supper.'</p>
        <p>When sunset came, the farmer and his dog herded the sheep into their pen and in went Mr Wolf as well. His disguise had worked.</p>
        <p>'Oh yeah, oh yeah, I m going to get me some juicy sheep!' said Mr Wolf to himself.</p>
        <p>'Mummy,' said one of the lambs, 'that sheep smells a bit funny!' 'Don t be rude,' said the lamb's mother.</p>
        <p>'Ha ha,' thought Mr Wolf, 'because you're so rude little lambie, you will be the first to be gobbled. Sheep are woolly, sheep are yummy Sheep are best in my tummy!'</p>
        <p>He flashed his claws and opened his jaws and was just about to pounce when…Farmer Foggarty appeared.</p>
        <p>He was ready for his supper too and he wasn't having beans and mashed potatoes in a heap. He wasn't having Bolognese. He was having SHEEP!</p>
        <p>he farmer looked at the herd carefully, he spotted the biggest, juiciest looking sheep and he hooked it with his shepherd's hook. It was Mr Wolf.</p>
        <p>'Drat,' thought Mr Wolf, 'I thought I was going to get my Sheepie Supper, but it looks like I’m the sheepie supper!' With a lightning fast wriggle he freed himself from the farmer’s hook…and off he shot as fast as his legs could go.</p>
        <p>'Excellent work,' said Farmer Fog- garty to his sheep, 'we fooled that wily Mr Wolf! Now I’m off to have my egg and chips!'</p>
